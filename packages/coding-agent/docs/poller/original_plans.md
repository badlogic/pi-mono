# Poller Plans (Pointer)

The detailed plan and guidance live in:
- `docs/poller/CONTRACT.md` — architecture, lifecycle, requirements, acceptance checklist.
- `docs/poller/QUICKSTART.md` — setup examples (ArangoDB/HTTP), wiring steps, troubleshooting.
- `docs/poller/README-poller.md` — concise usage/config notes.

This file intentionally stays minimal to keep the docs decoupled and easy to maintain.
