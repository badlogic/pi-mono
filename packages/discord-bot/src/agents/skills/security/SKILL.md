# Security Expert Skill

Expert-level security analysis for vulnerability detection and secure code practices.

## Capabilities

- **Vulnerability Scanning**: OWASP Top 10, CVE detection, secret scanning
- **Code Review**: Security-focused code analysis
- **Threat Modeling**: Attack surface analysis and risk assessment
- **Secure Coding**: Best practices and pattern enforcement
- **Smart Contract Audit**: Solidity/Rust contract security review

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Reviewing code for security vulnerabilities
- Scanning for exposed secrets or credentials
- Analyzing authentication/authorization flows
- Auditing smart contracts before deployment
- Threat modeling new features or systems

## Key Principles

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers
2. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal permissions
3. **Input Validation**: Never trust user input
4. **Secure by Default**: Secure configurations out of the box
5. **Audit Trail**: Log security-relevant events

## OWASP Top 10 Reference

1. Broken Access Control
2. Cryptographic Failures
3. Injection
4. Insecure Design
5. Security Misconfiguration
6. Vulnerable Components
7. Authentication Failures
8. Software Integrity Failures
9. Logging Failures
10. SSRF
