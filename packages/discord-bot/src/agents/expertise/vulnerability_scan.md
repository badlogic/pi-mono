**Task:** Scan this code for vulnerabilities: app.get('/user', (req, res) => { const id = req.query.id; db.que...

CRITICAL SQL injection vulnerability in the provided code. The user input is directly concatenated into SQL queries without validation or parameterization, allowing arbitrary SQL execution. Remediation requires implementing input validation and parameterized queries. This pattern suggests potential widespread vulnerabilities in the codebase that require comprehensive security auditing.
