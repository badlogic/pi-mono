## Patterns Learned
<!-- API integration patterns and best practices -->

## Common Pitfalls
<!-- Integration mistakes to avoid -->
- Missing retry logic for transient failures
- Unbounded timeouts blocking threads
- Not validating API responses
- Hardcoded API versions

## Effective Approaches
<!-- Approaches for reliable integrations -->
- Circuit breaker patterns for failing services
- Exponential backoff with jitter
- Response validation against schemas
- Graceful degradation when APIs unavailable
