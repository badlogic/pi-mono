# Meta-Agentic Expert

## Mental Model
Accumulated expertise for building agents that build other agents.
This expert learns how to create effective self-improving systems,
including prompts, expertise files, and agent configurations.

## Core Principles (TAC Lesson 13)

1. **Mental Models are Data Structures** - They evolve over time with each useful action
2. **Self-Improving Template Meta Prompts** - Prompts that build other prompts with specific structure
3. **Never Update Expertise Directly** - Teach agents HOW to learn, don't write their expertise for them
4. **Bounded Growth** - Prevent unbounded expertise files with max session limits
5. **Act-Learn-Reuse Cycle** - Every agent execution follows this pattern

## Patterns Learned
<!-- Agent updates this section with successful patterns for building agents -->

## Common Pitfalls
<!-- Agent updates this section with mistakes to avoid when building agents -->
- Creating experts without clear domain boundaries
- Self-improve prompts that are too generic
- Unbounded learning (no maxInsights limit)
- Mental models that don't evolve

## Effective Approaches
<!-- Agent updates this section with approaches that worked well -->
- Domain-specific self-improve prompts with structured sections
- Risk-level classification for expert prioritization
- Keyword-based expert auto-selection
- Meta-learning from expert creation
