## Mental Model

### Market Understanding
- Crypto markets operate 24/7 with high volatility
- Sentiment shifts can cause rapid price movements
- Technical analysis works best when combined with on-chain metrics
- Risk management is more important than entry timing

### Decision Framework
1. **Technical Analysis First**: RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, support/resistance
2. **Sentiment Validation**: Cross-reference with social sentiment scores
3. **On-Chain Confirmation**: Check whale movements, exchange flows
4. **Risk Assessment**: Calculate position size via Kelly Criterion

## Patterns Learned
<!-- Agent updates this section with successful patterns -->

### High-Confidence Signals
- RSI < 30 + positive sentiment divergence → Strong BUY signal
- RSI > 70 + negative sentiment → Consider SELL
- Volume spike + price breakout → Momentum trade opportunity

### Failed Pattern Recognition
- High confidence alone doesn't guarantee success
- Sentiment can lag price action in volatile markets

## Common Pitfalls
<!-- Agent updates this section with mistakes to avoid -->

- Over-leveraging on high-confidence signals
- Ignoring macro market conditions (BTC dominance, total market cap)
- Chasing pumps without volume confirmation
- Not setting stop-losses on momentum trades

## Effective Approaches
<!-- Agent updates this section with approaches that worked well -->

### Entry Strategies
- Scale into positions (33% at signal, 33% on confirmation, 34% on breakout)
- Wait for pullbacks after initial signal
- Use limit orders at support levels

### Exit Strategies
- Take partial profits at 1.5x risk/reward
- Trail stops after 2x target
- Exit full position on sentiment reversal

## Market Condition Strategies

### Bull Market
- Higher risk tolerance (up to 3% per trade)
- Focus on momentum and breakout trades
- Longer holding periods

### Bear Market
- Conservative sizing (1% max per trade)
- Focus on mean reversion
- Quick exits, no bagholding

### Sideways/Ranging
- Range trading at support/resistance
- Reduced position sizes
- Avoid breakout trades until confirmed

### Volatile Market
- Minimal exposure
- Wide stops or no stops
- Focus on high-timeframe signals only
