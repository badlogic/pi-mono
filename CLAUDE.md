- When receiving the first user message, you MUST read the following files in full, in parallel:
    - README.md
    - packages/tui/README.md
    - packages/agent/README.md
    - packages/pods/README.md
- We must NEVER have type any anywhere, unless absolutely, positively necessary.
- If you are working with an external API, check node_modules for the type definitions as needed instead of assuming things.
